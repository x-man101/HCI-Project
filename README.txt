The Campus Center Orders App aims to make ordering at the WPI CC faster, easier, and safe.
Given COVID times, students might feel concerned about their health when spending too
much time in public just to order in-person. Additionally, the use of plexiglass as a deterent 
of the virus spread has created a huge communication barrier between the server and student. 
As a result, orders often come out wrong or take longer to serve, making students frustrated. 
Campus Center Orders allows students to submit an order remotely knowing they will get everything
they ordered. The site will give an estimated time submitted by the server preparing the food
which allows students to plan their trip to the CC and limit their exposure. Also, this is a 
faster alternative to waiting in line and then standing around for up to 15 minutes when you
could arrive as soon as the food is ready.
